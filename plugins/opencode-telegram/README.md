# OpenCode Telegram

A TUI plugin that controls the `opencode-telegram` notification daemon from
inside OpenCode.

The daemon itself is a separate Go application. This plugin adds a
`/telegram` slash command and a palette command,
**OpenCode Telegram notifications**, which opens a settings picker:

- master notification switch (off by default);
- which events to deliver: session finished, failed, interrupted, questions,
  permissions, retry status;
- whether to include the last assistant message and the working directory;
- security switches for **custom answers** and **new messages** (both off by
  default);
- send a test notification.

Every change is applied immediately through the daemon's loopback API.

## Security switches

OpenCode Telegram deliberately separates *notifications* from *actions*:

| Setting | Default | What it enables |
|---|---|---|
| `allow_custom_form_answers` | off | Adds **“Type your own response”** to OpenCode questions, so arbitrary text can be sent back into a form. |
| `allow_new_messages` | off | Lets free-text Telegram messages become prompts for the session bound to that chat. |

These are the only ways Telegram can inject content into OpenCode. If you do
not fully trust every Telegram account and device with access to the bot, leave
them off and answer questions inside OpenCode. The switches are intentionally
not exposed through the Telegram bot itself.

## Loading

Add the plugin to `opencode.json(c)` (project or global):

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugins": ["/home/snow/oc_tools/plugins/opencode-telegram"]
}
```

Or use a package name once published. The package has a no-op server part so
OpenCode loads the TUI part. Run `/reload` in the TUI after changing plugin
configuration.

## Daemon URL

The plugin talks to the daemon at `http://127.0.0.1:8787` by default. Override
it with plugin options or environment variables:

```jsonc
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "package": "/home/snow/oc_tools/plugins/opencode-telegram",
      "options": {
        "daemonUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8787",
        "token": "optional-bearer-token"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Environment fallbacks: `OPENCODE_TELEGRAM_URL`,
`OPENCODE_TELEGRAM_TOKEN`.

If the daemon is not reachable, the plugin shows the URL it tried and suggests
`opencode-telegram start`.

## Requirements

- OpenCode v2.2 or newer.
- The `opencode-telegram` daemon running on the same machine (or reachable over
  a private network) with its loopback settings API enabled.
